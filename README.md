* (Q1) Fill the following table.
    
    The parameter values and the accuracy are based on the best model you obtained. The run time is the total run time printed by the program.
    
| Parameter       | Value                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| numFeatures     | 2048                         |
| fitIntercept    | false                        |
| regParam        | 1.0E-4                       |
| maxIter         | 10.0                         |
| threshold       | 0.0                          |
| tol             | 0.01                         |
| Test accuracy   | 0.8198352924547856           |
| Run time        | 409.7034378 seconds          |

* (Q3) What difference do you notice in terms of the best parameters selected, the accuracy, and the run time between running the program locally and on your Spark cluster having multiple nodes?

My entire lab group was absent for this lab session and the last lab, so I configured my Spark and Hadoop so that I could do the lab by myself (The TA told me to do so). There were no changes in the best parameters selected, the accuracy, and the run time between running the program locally and on my Spark cluster.
